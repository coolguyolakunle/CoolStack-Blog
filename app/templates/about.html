        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                I’m <strong>Olakunle Martins</strong>, a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> and <strong>Filmmaker</strong> passionate about building innovative digital products and telling meaningful stories.
            </p>

            <p>
                At <strong>CoolStack</strong>, I combine technical precision with creative direction — designing and developing modern web solutions while bringing cinematic storytelling into the digital space. My approach bridges <em>logic</em> and <em>art</em>: every project is crafted with functionality, aesthetics, and a clear purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a background in software development and visual storytelling, I focus on creating seamless user experiences through clean architecture, responsive design, and intuitive interfaces. From <strong>Flask-based applications</strong> to interactive front-end experiences, my work emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and impact.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a filmmaker, I translate that same attention to detail into visual narratives that evoke emotion and spark reflection. This blend of disciplines shapes how I think, design, and build — turning ideas into experiences that connect.
            </p>

            <p class="closing-line">
                <strong>CoolStack</strong> represents the synergy of <em>creativity</em> and <em>technology</em> — a platform for building, experimenting, and innovating across mediums.
